# No-ise - GWT / AAA

Both share some principles, including **grouping** code related to particular
actions, thus make the code more structured.

<br/>

AAA - **Arrange**, **Act**, **Assert**

GWT - **Given**, **When**, **Then**
<br/><br/>

Many say that AAA does not fit into checking business requirements.

<br/><br/>

## Is this a reason why we cannot describe our module/unit behavior?
